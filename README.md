# hello_github
Hi hello, just a newb figuring out how to do this whole thing. 
The github tutorial tells me that I need to write some things here so that I can see how to edit branches. Weee!!
So I'm back again, just to make sure that I remember how to do this whole process without looking at the tutorial.
